In this project, a given data about a store's annual revenue of the year 2022 has been cleaned, analysed and visualized through Microsoft Excel. Here were the steps:

• The data set was opened in Excel and the null and duplicate values were detected and removed using the Filter tool.
• Two Columns were created: Age Group and Month of Sale - which would be utilised later on during the analysis phase.
• Using Pivot table and establishing relationships, different charts were created and accumulated on a seperate worksheet to create a dashboard. Slicers have been added to the dashboard to make the interactions more granular.

In this method, the overall data analysis of the store's annual revenue can be understood and several business decisions can be concluded.
